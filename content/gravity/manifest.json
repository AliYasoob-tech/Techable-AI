Sir Isaac Newton proposed that this force is 'universal'—it's the same force that makes an apple fall to the ground and also keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth.",

Its value is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2). This means an object's velocity increases by 9.8 m/s for every second it falls.",

Weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass. You can calculate it with the formula: Weight = mass × g. This is why your mass is the same on the Moon, but your weight is much less, because the Moon's 'g' is weaker.",

'g' is the local acceleration due to gravity, which changes depending on the planet you are on (e.g., 'g' on Earth is 9.8 m/s^2, but on the Moon it's only 1.6 m/s^2).",

An orbit is a perfect balance between an object's forward speed (its inertia) and the pull of gravity. Astronauts on the Space Station feel 'weightless' because they, and the station, are in a constant state of freefall *around* the Earth.",
